Numerous roads remain closed due to flooding. Streams continue to rise due to excess runoff from earlier rainfall. It will take several hours for all the water from these storms to work through local drainage systems in urban areas.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS... - At 351 PM PST, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges indicated heavy rain. Flooding is already occurring in the warned area. Between 2 and 4 inches of rain have fallen. - Additional rainfall amounts up to 0.1 to 0.3 inches are possible in the warned area. Small streams and rivers are currently cresting and will most likely begin to fall within the next couple of hours. - Some locations that will experience flooding include Sunny Brae, the Elk River Basin, Hookton Slough, and urban areas around Eureka. - http://www.weather.gov/safety/flood\nTurn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood deaths occur in vehicles.\nBe aware of your surroundings and do not drive on flooded roads.\nPlease report observed flooding to local emergency services or law enforcement and request they pass this information to the National Weather Service when you can do so safely.\nhttp://www.weather.gov\nAWIPSidentifier\nFLWEKA\n\nWMOidentifier\nWGUS46 KEKA 242351\nNWSheadline\nFLOOD WARNING NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 545 PM PST THIS AFTERNOON\nBLOCKCHANNEL\nEAS\n\nBLOCKCHANNEL\nNWEM\n\nEAS-ORG\nWXR\n\nVTEC\n\n/O.EXT.KEKA.FA.W.0005.000000T0000Z-260225T0145Z/\neventEndingTime\n2026-02-24T17:45:00-08:00\nBLOCKCHANNEL\nCMAS\n\nexpiredReferences\nw-nws.webmaster@noaa.gov,urn:oid:2.49.0.1.840.0.0768c9eda9d661a799f9544d558e0c61955127db.001.1,2026-02-24T11:17:00-08:00\nHumboldt, CA\n40.7,-124.22 40.7,-124.21 40.71,-124.22 40.71,-124.21 40.72,-124.22 40.73,-124.22 40.75,-124.2 40.77,-124.2 40.76,-124.19 40.78,-124.2 40.8,-124.18 40.77,-124.04 40.55,-124.12 40.57,-124.31 40.69,-124.24 40.68,-124.23 40.7,-124.22\nSAME\n\n006023\nUGC\n\nCAC023",
